### Test Notes for form.js

#### Objective:
- Validate the functionality and logic of the JavaScript file `form.js`, which manages dynamic behavior and interaction logic for the form page.

#### Test Scope:
- Test the functions and event handlers within `form.js` to ensure they perform as intended based on user interactions.

#### Test Cases:

1. **Clamp Function (`clamp()`):**
   - Input: Minimum, maximum, and a value within range
   - Expected Output: Value within the specified range

2. **Show/Hide Option Functions (`hide_option()` and `show_option()`):**
   - Input: Form ID
   - Expected Output: Corresponding form element hidden/shown

3. **Attribute ID Retrieval Function (`get_form_id()`):**
   - Input: Attribute name
   - Expected Output: Full HTML form ID

4. **Change Handler Registration Function (`register_handler()`):**
   - Input: Attribute ID and handler function
   - Expected Output: Handler function attached to the attribute

5. **`fix_num_cores()` Function:**
   - Input: Node type selection
   - Expected Output: Proper adjustment of the number of cores based on node type

6. **`set_ppn_by_node_type()` Function:**
   - Input: Node type selection
   - Expected Output: Proper setting of 'per-process number' of cores based on node type

7. **Toggle Visibility of Advanced Options (`toggle_visibility_of_advanced_options()`):**
   - Input: 'advanced_options' checkbox value
   - Expected Output: Visibility of advanced options toggled based on checkbox state

8. **Hide Advanced Options When Not Needed (`toggle_advanced_options_visibility()`):**
   - Input: Advanced fields' IDs
   - Expected Output: Advanced options hidden when not required

9. **Event Handlers Setup:**
   - Input: Simulated changes in 'node_type', 'advanced_options', and 'jupyter_location'
   - Expected Output: Corresponding UI changes based on the events triggered

#### Notes:
- Verify the proper execution of each function and event handler to ensure they interact as expected with the form elements.
- Test edge cases, such as boundary values for clamping, to ensure the functions handle them correctly.
- Check for synchronization between user inputs and UI changes.

#### Recommendations:
- Thoroughly test each function and event handler to confirm their responsiveness to different user interactions.
- Validate the compatibility of these functions with the actual form elements used in the application.
- Ensure that custom event handlers, if added, are correctly integrated and functioning as intended.
