# This file defines all the attributes that your application needs to run!
# Later on, when starting your app, you can reference these attributes
# and use them to start your app the way the end user wants.
# This file also defines how these attributes are shown to the end user

form:

  # Below lie some generic options.
  # Functionality for these options is built into this template!
  # We HIGHLY recommend keeping these options and their configuration,
  # as they are applicable to most apps.

  - modules  # A list of modules that are to be automatically loaded
  - is_vnc  # A value determining if we are a VNC app, be sure to set it down below!
  - bc_num_hours  # The number of hours the user wants your app to run for
  - bc_num_slots  # The number of slots your app will use, hardcoded
  - num_cores  # The number of cores the user wants to dedicate to your app
  - memory  # The amount of memory the user wants to dedicate to your app

  # Below, you can add some of your own options!
  # These can really be anything you think is important.
  # Your options should be robust and highly configurable,
  # but they should have good sensible defaults for users
  # who don't want to fiddle around with settings.

  # ?[Add your own form options]?

  # +==============================================+

  # Below lie advanced options, edit if you dare!
  # These are pretty generic, and offer some addition options.
  # You most likely don't have to touch these

  - bc_email_on_started  # A checkbox determining if the user wants to be emailed when their app is ready
  - advanced_options  # A check box toggling the visibility of advanced options
  - node_type  # The node type the user wants
  - num_gpus  # The number of GPUs the user wants
  - num_tasks  # The number of tasks that user wants
  - bc_account  # The account to use
  - qos  # ????
  - reservation  # SLURM reservation ID ???
  - bc_vnc_resolution   # Resolution for the VNC instance
attributes:

  # Here, you can add definitions to the attributes you defined!
  # It is highly recommended to do so,
  # as it makes using the front end easier and can cut down on misconfiguration errors.

  # BE SURE TO SPECIFY IF THIS APP IS A VNC APP OR NOT!
  # This app will self-configure itself depending on the value of this parameter!
  # As a reminder, a VNC is an app that will start on the HPC desktop.
  # The user will then utilize a VNC client in the web browser to see and interact
  # with the desktop, and your application you configured.
  # If your app is not a VNC app,
  # then set this value to 'false'!

  # +==============================================+

  is_vnc: true  # ![Specify if this app is VNC or not!]!

  # +==============================================+

  # Here you should specify the modules to be automatically loaded.
  # This should be a string with space separated module names.
  # These modules are passed directly to the module load command,
  # so any names and syntax for module names apply here.
  # For example, if you don't want to add any modules:
  # modules: ""
  # If you want to add one module:
  # modules: "mod"
  # If you want to add multiple modules:
  # modules: "mod1 mod2 mod3"

  # +==============================================+

  modules: ""  # ?[Specify modules to auto-load]?

  # Below, you should add the definitions to any attributes you have set!

  # ?[Add your option definitions here]?

  # Below lies the definitions for the default options.
  # It is recommended not to alter these at all!
